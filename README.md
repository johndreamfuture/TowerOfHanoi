# TowerOfHanoi
My first Tower of Hanoi game which is a mathematical puzzle.
It is a mathematical game consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. 

# How to play
The puzzle can be played with any  disks you choose.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack from the left area(left container) to middle area(middle container) or right area(right container), obeying the following rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move can take the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty area.
- No disk can be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
